    <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      <p>My name is Bronagh Falloon, my email is S3965252@student.rmit..edu.au [picture]
 I am of British descent my family came over to Australia when I was 1 year old from New Zealand and we got Australian citizenship in 2014. I got a cert IV in healthcare and then studied nursing for 2 years I now work at factory blinds making hollands, if you weren’t dont know this what a holland is;
 [insert pic here of a holland]. One odd hobby I have is learning personality systems, I’ve spent many hours learning MBTI and then I learnt about functions which in the context of MBTI are the extroverted or introverted versions of Feeling, Thinking, Sensing, and Intuitive. A few years ago, a youtuber came out with an expanded system that came from MBTI called objective personality types and has 512 types. S which I have spent over a hundred hours learning</p>
    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
      <p>  I became interested in IT at 8 years old when I was trying to set up a simulated windows setup on the family mac book, I ended up hard resetting the computer by accident. Over the years I’ve ended up being the family go-to for IT support; from helping my mum set up her new phone, my older brother login to discord, or my twin printing a pdf on both sides of the page. While helping my family I developed a real interest and passion for IT. With helping my computer illiterate brother I’ve become interested in how we can make computers and websites more intuitive and easier to use
I chose to study at RMIT because I was looking for a fully online degree in software engineering, I was enrolling through open universities when they recommended RMIT.
I expect to learn how to code, build websites, and apps. I want to learn how operating systems function and how big data is analyzed [reference in here]. I’m interested in how users intuitively use technology and websites how that can be improved through design choses.
</p>
    <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
      <p>In position, I would work in the design and development of the user experience working with the product design team. I would be talking with stakeholders to understand what they need from the user interface to inform the design of the user experience information flow and user interface. Making the conceptual diagrams, site maps, and interaction flows, storyboards, page/screen schematics/wireframes, content inventories, help and instructional copy. Working to make a product easy to use and beautiful holds a lot of appeal to me, as I believe that it can make peoples life just that little bit easier.
    I like the idea of being able to make a high-quality product that meets the needs of others, I believe I would enjoy improving the user experience and working to make it intuitive as possible. I truly enjoy team working and helping others so bring the visual design into reality I would find engaging and enjoyable.
      <h3> Skills need for my ideal job </h3>
        </p>This Job needs strong skills in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Markdown. I would need to be competent in current front-end technologies and pre-processing platforms. The job also needs an understanding of graphic applications like photoshop.
        <h3>Skills I already have</h3>
        <h3>My plan to get the skills I need</h3>
          <p>I would need to learn HTML and CSS which I can began to do by completing the HTML & SCC crash course on scrimba then I should learn JavaScript which I will learn in my next study period. I would need to gain further experience with graphic applications, I already use procreate but completing a free course for photoshop editing would be beneficial.</p>
    <h1>Personality Profile</h1>
        <h3> MBTI; INFP</h3>
          <p>My results of the Myers-Briggs test were INFP. For me this means I enjoy having an open mind listening to new possibilities, I have a real interest in other people and want to work with people to achieve our shared goals. Being an introvert, I can become tired easily and need to ensure I have time to recharge. Being an intuitive (unintuitively represented by a N) I can be easily distracted and get lost in the possible, I try and work to remain grounded to what is feasible.</p>
        <h3>Learning style; Visual</h3>
          <p>I am a visual learner which means I understand concepts better when they are represented in a way that shows the connections between things using charts, diagrams, or mind maps. I find I need to have some kind of visuals, usually note taking, to remain engaged in a lecture or podcast.</p>
        <h3>Third test ennegram; type 2</h3>
          <p>I tested as a type 2 which means I am an empathic person motivated by a desire to gain approval; I see this in how I enjoy working to meet other people’s vision and making sure they have what they need to succeed. In a team this means I can pitch in were needed and find working with other people highly motivating, though I can focus too much on other people’s working neglecting my own which means that my work isn’t done, and I can become resentful toward others because of feeling overwhelmed. This is something I try to be aware of and I work not to blame other people because I chose to help them.</p>
  <h1> My Project Idea </h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>I am planning to build a website that allows users to learn the objective personality system (OPS). OPS is based on MBTI, Carl Young. The website would provide a brief overview of the system then introduce the user to chart where they can experiment with system; for example, if they selected that they were an extrovert it removes all the introverted types from the chart with a brief explanation why the types were removed.
    It would aim to help you learn OPS without having to go through mounds of content.</p>
    <h2>motivation</h2>
      <p>This website would be useful introduce people to OPS and allow people understand what the types mean. If you are not familiar with OPS or MBTI it can be almost impossible to understand as those already familiar use a lot of jargon and acronyms. This tool would help people to understand the terminology and learn to type.
      The only thing like this is subjectivepersonality.com (Hosler, 2020) but it requires reading a lot of text and the typing tool needs you to understand the system to be useable.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>OPS has 9 binary coins, 8 functions, 4 human needs, and 4 animals. All these stacks and interact with one another, which can lead to confusion. The introduction page would include a sentence description of each part followed by the typing chart. The typing chart is the main focus as it is the unique part of the project. </p>

    <h4>Part One the Chart</h4>
      <p>This would look like Hosler’s typing chart expect you would input each part individually, and it would eliminate the types excluded by the input, i.e.  inputting that you are a Senser would remove all Intuitive types.</p>
    <h4>Part Two Learning to Type</h4>
      <p>The other aspect of this project is learning to type, to do this the website would allow users to select a celebrity or add their own; If they user is uploading their own, they would be to upload a photo of the person and the videos they used to type them and then the type they choose with a section to justify their decision. Then other users can input the type they decided and then they can view what everyone else has said.</p>
  <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p></p>
  <h2>Skills Needed</h2>
    <p>To make this project happen I would need to learn front-end languages to build the user interface like HTML and CSS with JavaScript so the users can interact with the website. I would need to learn python for the backend as well. In addition, a basic understanding of good user experience design and graphic design would be need. If the data is being collected an understanding of how to store and interpret the data to improve the performance would be beneficial. To run the website I would need to learn how to host a website.</p>
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>If the project works, there will be a simple easy to use tool to learn objective personality system, learn to type other people and allow people to be typed by others in the community. It would provide way of understanding your own type without having to learn the entire system (which has 512 types in total).</p>
