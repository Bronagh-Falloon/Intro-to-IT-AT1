    <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      <p>My name is Bronagh Falloon, my email is S3965252@student.rmit..edu.au  <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c6l21ndkae63msz/IMG_20220122_204112220_HDR%20-%20Copy.jpg?dl=0" alt="profile" width="500" height="600"> <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jbe7crsig7mtojz/20220619_205323.jpg?dl=0" alt="drawing of profile" width="500" height="600">
        I look antsy in the photo because I took it as reference photo for this drawing.
       I am of British descent. My family came over to Australia when I was 1 year old from New Zealand and we got Australian citizenship in 2014. I got a cert IV in healthcare and then studied nursing for 2 years. I now work in a local business making holland blinds, if you weren’t aware this what a holland is see picture below:

       I was homeschooled until grade 10; it was a great experience, and I was able to pursue my own interests like drawing. I’m looking forward to seeing how studying online at university compares to home schooling and seeing what areas I need to focus on.
</p>
    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
      <p>  I became interested in IT at 8 years old when I was trying to set up a simulated windows setup on the family Macbook, and I ended up hard resetting the computer by accident.
Over the years I’ve ended up being the family go-to for IT support; from helping my mum set up her new phone to helping my older brother login to discord, or my twin printing a pdf on both sides of the page. While helping my family I developed a real interest and passion for IT. Through helping my family when they struggle with technology, I’ve become interested in how we can make computers and websites more intuitive and easier to use.
I chose to study at RMIT because I was looking for a fully online degree in software engineering, and when I was enrolling through open universities, I was recommended RMIT.
I expect to learn how to code, build websites and apps. I want to learn how operating systems function and how big data is analyzed. I’m interested in how users intuitively use technology and websites, and how that can be improved through design decisions. I want to learn about programming languages and how they function. I’m excited to learn how to work with team and build projects with them.

</p>
    <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
      <p>In this position, I would work in the design and development of the user experience working with the product design team. I would be talking with stakeholders to understand what they need from the user interface to inform the design of the user experience information flow and user interface. Part of my role would be to create conceptual diagrams, site maps, interaction flows, storyboards, page/screen schematics/wireframes, content inventories and help and instructional copy.
Working to make a product easy to use and beautiful holds a lot of appeal to me, as I believe that it can make people’s lives easier.
I like the idea of being able to make a high-quality product that meets the needs of others, I believe I would enjoy improving the user experience and working to make it intuitive as possible. I truly enjoy team working and helping others so bring the visual design into reality I would find engaging and enjoyable.
      <h3> Skills need for my ideal job </h3>
        <p>TThis Job needs strong skills in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Markdown. I would need to be competent in current front-end technologies and pre-processing platforms. The job also needs an understanding of graphic applications like photoshop.</p>
        <h3>Skills I already have</h3>
        <p>I am just beginning to learn these skills now, for example learning HTLM and CSS in this unit. I have a basic understanding of graphic applications.</p>
        <h3>My plan to get the skills I need</h3>
          <p>I plan to learn HTML and CSS, beginning by completing the HTML & SCC crash course on scrimba. I plan learn JavaScript in my next study period. I need to gain further experience with graphic applications, I plan to do this by following online tutorials and lectures or taking additional courses.</p>
    <h1>Personality Profile</h1>
        <h3> MBTI; INFP</h3>
          <p>My results of the Myers-Briggs test were INFP. For me this means I enjoy having an open mind listening to new possibilities, I have a real interest in other people and want to work with people to achieve our shared goals. Being an introvert, I can become tired easily and need to ensure I have time to recharge. Being an intuitive (unintuitively represented by a N) I can be easily distracted and get lost in the possible, I should try and work to remain grounded to what is feasible (16Personalities, 2012).</p>
        <h3>Learning style; Visual</h3>
          <p>I am a visual learner which means I understand concepts better when they are represented in a way that shows the connections between things using charts, diagrams, or mind maps. I find I need to have visuals, usually note taking, to remain engaged in a lecture or podcast (VARK, 2022).</p>
        <h3>Third test ennegram; type 2</h3>
          <p>I tested as a type 2 which means I am an empathic person motivated by a desire to gain approval; I see this in how I enjoy working to meet other people’s vision and making sure they have what they need to succeed. In a team this means I can pitch in were needed and find working with other people highly motivating, though I can focus too much on other people’s working neglecting my own which means that my work isn’t done, and I can become resentful toward others because of feeling overwhelmed. This is something I try to be aware of and I work not to blame other people because I chose to help them (institute, 2021).</p>
          <h3>How these results relate to team work</h3>
          <p>In a team setting these results mean I’m likely to be a people pleaser who can lose focus on the actual goal and become distracted by trying to keep everyone happy (I can attest that this pitfall can lead to things going very badly). I use these results as a reminder to focus on what’s important (the end goal) and not to blame others for my own decisions (institute, 2021) (16Personalities, 2012).</p>
          <h3>Forming a team</h3>
          <p>When building a team, I think of these test results to identify likely areas of conflict, for example Judgers might find Perceivers to be disorganized and unable to decide while Perceivers may think the Judger uptight and unclosed to new ideas. Using tools like MBTI is a great way to address these differences without attacking the other person or laying blaming (Thompson, 2022).I would use these results to help me identify areas in which I am weaker and choose members to fill in those gaps. (Thompson, 2022)</p>
  <h1> My Project Idea </h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>I am planning to build a website that allows users to learn the objective personality system (OPS) (Personality, 2022). OPS is based on MBTI, the theory proposed by Carl Young. The website would provide a brief overview of the system then introduce the user to chart where they can experiment with system; for example, if they selected that they were an extrovert it removes all the introverted types from the chart with a brief explanation why the types were removed. It would aim to help you learn OPS without having to go through mounds of content. This would help kept the process fun and engaging for the user.  </p>
    <h2>motivation</h2>
      <p>This website would be useful introduce people to OPS and allow people understand what the types mean. If you are not familiar with OPS or MBTI it can be almost impossible to understand as those already familiar use a lot of jargon and acronyms. This tool would help people to understand the terminology and learn to type.
 The only thing like this is subjectivepersonality.com (Hosler, 2020) but it requires reading a lot of text and the typing tool requires you to already have an understanding of the system to be useable.
</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>OPS has 9 binary coins, 8 functions, 4 human needs, and 4 animals. All these stacks and interact with one another, which can lead to much confusion. The introduction page would include a sentence description of each part followed by the typing chart. The typing chart is the focus as it is the unique part of the project.  </p>

    <h4>Part One the Chart</h4>
      <p>This would look like Hosler’s typing chart prompting the user to input each data point individually, and it would eliminate the types excluded by the input, i.e.  inputting that the user is a Senser would remove all Intuitive types. Every time the user made a change a small icon would appear which if selected would explain why types were eliminated or made available again (Hosler, 2020).</p>
    <h4>Part Two Learning to Type</h4>
      <p>The other aspect of this project is helping users to learn to type. To achieve this the website would allow users to type a person about whom information have been uploaded to the site to aid in typing them. For example, interview clips of celebrities could be linked on the site, allowing multiple users to review the clips and post their analysis of which type would best describe the person. This analysis could then be shared with other users of the website. Other users can provide feedback on the analysis performed and share their own analysis. </p>
  <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p>Investigation would need to be undertaken to determine the best technological options to host the website, store the information, secure the account information for users and to perform user authentication.  </p>
  <h2>Skills Needed</h2>
    <p>To make this project happen I would need to learn front-end languages to build the user interface like HTML and CSS with JavaScript so the users can interact with the website. I need to learn how to authenticate users and how to manage any privacy or legal issues regarding the videos being linked to.
I would need to learn python to use for parts of the backend because it’s easier to learn (Giampedraglia, 2019). In addition, a basic understanding of good user experience design and graphic design would be need. If the data is being collected an understanding of how to store and interpret the data to improve the performance would be beneficial. To launch the website, I would need to learn how to host and maintain a website.
</p>
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>If the project works, there would be fun and interactive way understand OPS and with simple easy to use tool to learn objective personality system, learn to type other people and allow people to be typed by others in the community.
If the project was highly successful it would help increase the popularity of the system and enable it to be tested in more through and scientific fashion by analyzing the data produced from the website. It would provide way of understanding your own type without having to learn the entire system (which has 512 types in total).
