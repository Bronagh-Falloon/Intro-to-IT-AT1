    <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      <p>My name is Bronagh Falloon, my email is S3965252@student.rmit..edu.au [picture]
 I am of British descent my family came over to Australia when I was 1 year old from New Zealand and we got Australian citizenship in 2014. I got a cert IV in healthcare and then studied nursing for 2 years I now work at factory blinds making hollands, if you weren’t dont know this what a holland is;
 [insert pic here of a holland]. I was homeschooled for all my educations before starting a cert IV in grade 10, I don't know how I passed as I didn't put in a lot of work honestly. I taught myself how to draw and paint which I now use as stress relief</p>
    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
      <p>  I became interested in IT at 8 years old when I was trying to set up a simulated windows setup on the family mac book, I ended up hard resetting the computer by accident. Over the years I’ve ended up being the family go-to for IT support; from helping my mum set up her new phone, my older brother login to discord, or my twin printing a pdf on both sides of the page. While helping my family I developed a real interest and passion for IT. With helping my computer illiterate brother I’ve become interested in how we can make computers and websites more intuitive and easier to use
I chose to study at RMIT because I was looking for a fully online degree in software engineering, I was enrolling through open universities when they recommended RMIT.
I expect to learn how to code, build websites, and apps. I want to learn how operating systems function and how big data is analyzed [reference in here]. I’m interested in how users intuitively use technology and websites how that can be improved through design choses.

    <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
    <p>In position, I would work in the design and development of the user experience working with the product design team. I would be talking with stakeholders to understand what they need from the user interface to inform the design of the user experience information flow and user interface. Making the conceptual diagrams, site maps, and interaction flows, storyboards, page/screen schematics/wireframes, content inventories, help and instructional copy. Working to make a product easy to use and beautiful holds a lot of appeal to me, as I believe that it can make peoples life just that little bit easier.
I like the idea of being able to make a high-quality product that meets the needs of others, I believe I would enjoy improving the user experience and working to make it intuitive as possible. I truly enjoy team working and helping others so bring the visual design into reality I would find engaging and enjoyable.
